Dominica Population 2022. https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/dominica-population] . Dominica became a member of the West Indian Federation in 1958 in its search for independence and was granted independence as a republic in 1978, after becoming an associate state of the United Kingdom in 1967.

Dominica is a parliamentary democracy. As a Republic, the head of State is the president, who is elected for a five-year term by the parliament after being nominated by the prime minister and the opposition leader. The executive branch also includes the prime minister, the head of the government, who is the leader of the majority party in the parliament and is appointed by the president. 

The Legislative branch is made up of the House of Representatives, with a total of 32 members; 21 are regional representatives elected for a five-year term and 9 are senators appointed by the president, five on the advice of the prime minister, and four on the advice of the opposition leader. The president is also considered a member of the parliament, and the last seat is for the speaker of the House of Assembly, elected by the elected members after an election. The latest general elections were held on December 2019 resulting in a victory for the ruling party, the Dominica Labour Party. 

As a small country, Dominica mainly relies on its membership in international and regional organizations to make its vote count, therefore most of its foreign policy is exercised through these forums. At the international level, Dominica is a member of CARIFORUM, CARICOM, the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States, and the Organization of American States (OAS)^[Centro de Estudios Internacionales Gilberto Bosques.

##	Dominica’s RBM profile

The government of Dominica has set a clear long-term goal to be achieved: to become the first climate-resilient country in the world. After the passage of a Category 5 Hurricane in 2017, the nation was challenged to recover from damages and losses estimated at 226% of its GDP. It was acknowledged that an integrated national RBM System must be implemented to achieve this ambitious goal.

There have been significant efforts in terms of planning to translate Dominica’s bold vision into a reality, using a results-oriented approach. The creation of the Climate Resilient Executive Agency for Dominica (CREAD), an agency with different mandates and functions to transform Dominica’s vision into a reality constitutes a significant step to ensure that government interventions stay on track and the intended results are delivered. The National Resilient Development Strategy 2030 (NRDS) provides a path with specific results to be achieved by 2030, all within a framework oriented to becoming a climate-resilient country. This plan was complemented with Dominica’s Climate Resilience and Recovery Plan 2020–2030 (CRRP), a document that operationalises the NRDS and has a robust monitoring matrix that facilitates the tracking of priority initiatives, as well as identifying responsibilities for its implementation. 


In terms of M&E, there are significant advances in the implementation of coordinated monitoring activities. The Ministry of Planning, Economic Development, Climate Resilience, Sustainable Development, and Renewable Energy (Ministry of Planning from here on)  coordinates periodic monitoring exercises with all the ministries. On a monthly basis, the ministries submit a report (with programmatic and financial data) to the Ministry of Planning to track the progress made in implementing the planned activities, assess the achievement of outputs and outcomes, as well as the budget implementation by the source of funds. Also, the government is working on the development of a Monitoring and Evaluation Framework as part of a national effort to introduce an integrated results-based management system within the public sector.

Regarding the national budget, there are different normative frameworks that guide the budgeting activities in Dominica. Both the Ministries of Planning and the Ministry of Finance and Investment (Ministry of Finance from here on) oversee the development of the national budget. The Ministry of Finance has the overall responsibility for the preparation of the budget. In the case of the interventions included in the Public Sector Investment Programme (PSIP), information on its past performance is requested in the Budget Application. 

Multiple stakeholders have acknowledged the importance of developing and implementing a sustainable RBM System in Dominica. Having the aspirational vision of becoming the first climate-resilient country in the world requires the adoption of a results-oriented approach that is transversal in the planning, budgeting, and implementation activities performed by the government. It is crucial to ensure that the public sector is focused on achieving the targets set in the national planning, and systematic M&E activities will allow them to track their efforts and stay on track.
